**Hey. 👋🏻**  
I am Manu. Welcome to my website!

I'm from Germany. I'm currently studying
[Information Systems (M.Sc.) at TUM](https://www.tum.de/studium/studienangebot/detail/wirtschaftsinformatik-master-of-science-msc).
I'm also working for [smapiot](https://smapiot.com).
I like everything related to software development.

On this website, I will _(ideally)_ be publishing blog posts, articles, updates and thoughts semi-frequently.
Whether that will actually happen... We will see. In the meantime, thanks for stopping by!
