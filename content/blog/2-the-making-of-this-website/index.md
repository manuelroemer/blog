There is a saying that the first task on a ToDo list should be "Write a ToDo list".
In that spirit, the first (real) post on a new blog should be about the blog itself.
This post will describe the motivation for and the superficial technical details of this blog
(or rather, the website).

## The Motivation - Why Create a Website?

I've had this domain lying around unused for a year already.
Initially, I only bought it for having a custom E-Mail address.
Back then, I already considered building a website, but it was a plan that kept being pushed back
in favor of other tasks or simply normal life.
Besides, I could never really decide on what purpose I wanted my hypothetical website to _achieve_.
Do I want to build a flashy portfolio? Do I want to create a blog? Do I want to have
a minimal site for showing personal information?
This decision-to-be-made lingered in the back of my ToDo list for about a year until a few weeks
ago, when I read a random comment on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com) claiming how valueable
having a blog is.
Newly motivated by this comment, I decided to finally tackle this task and created a mental list of
goals and non-goals that I wanted my website-to-be to fulfill:

**Goals:**

- ❗️ It _must_ be as **cheap** as possible (#student-budget).
- ❗️ It _must_ be as simple as possible to **maintain** the page, ideally for a **long time**.
- ❗️ It _must_ be possible to **set** the **initial** website **up** in a relatively **short timeframe**.
- ❕ It _should_ be possible to create "content-pages" (e.g. for a blog) and "normal HTML-based pages"
  (e.g. for the homepage).
- ❔ It would be _nice_ to be able to write **content** in a markup language like **Markdown** or **AsciiDoc**.
- ❔ It would be _nice_ to be able to use **Git** for **content management**.

**Non-Goals:**

- ❌ It _does not_ need a fully-fledged CMS.
- ❌ It _does not_ need interactivity (e.g. comment-boxes) and/or account management.
- ❌ It _does not_ need a flashy, custom design **in the first version**.

## Choosing The Technology

Driven by the above points, I went on a market research regarding which technologies are out there.
One thing became clear very quickly:
There are very many options out there for building your own website/blog.
Too many, in fact.
In a certain sense, it felt overwhelming.
From toolbox-like frameworks to plug-and-play solutions, from Astro to Wordpress, there are a lot options
which all have their respective pros and cons which would have to be evaluated.
In the end, I decided to short-circuit the process by choosing an application that was often recommended
in various online forums: Hugo.

### Hugo

Hugo seems to be an established solution for a lot of blogs.

### Pico.css

### GitHub Pages

### NPM and Prettier

## Building The Website

## Deploying The Website

## Outlook and Conclusion
