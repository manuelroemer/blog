There is a saying that the first task on a ToDo list should be "Write a ToDo list".
In that spirit, the first (real) post on a new blog should be about the blog itself.
This post will describe the motivation for and the superficial technical details of this blog
(or rather, the website).

## The Motivation - Why Create a Website?

I've had this domain lying around unused for a year already.
Initially, I only bought it for having a custom E-Mail address.
I already considered building a website back then, but it was a plan that kept being pushed back
in favor of other tasks or simply normal life.
Besides, I could never really decide on what purpose I wanted my hypothetical website to _achieve_.
Do I want to build a flashy portfolio? Do I want to create a blog? Do I want to just have
a minimal site for showing personal information?
This decision also has a direct influence on the technology.
For a portfolio, I'd choose a different "stack" than for a blog.
This decision to be made lingered in the back of my ToDo list for about a year until a few weeks
ago, when I was motivated by a comment on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com) about how easy it
is to build and maintain your own blog.
Newly motivated by this comment, I decided to finally tackle this task and created a mental list of
goals and non-goals that I wanted my website-to-be to fulfill:

**Goals:**
- ❗️ It *must* be as **cheap** as possible (#student-budget)
- ❗️ It *must* be as simple as possible to **maintain** the page, ideally for a **long time**
- ❗️ It *must* be possible to **set** the **initial** website **up** in a relatively **short timeframe**
- ❕ It *should* be possible to create "content-pages" (e.g. for a blog) and "normal HTML-based pages" 
     (e.g. for the homepage)
- ❔ It would be *nice* to be able to write **content** in a markup language like **Markdown** or **AsciiDoc**
- ❔ It would be *nice* to be able to use **Git** for **content management**

## Choosing The Technology

### Hugo

### Pico.css

### GitHub Pages

### NPM and Prettier

## Building The Website

## Deploying The Website

## Outlook and Conclusion
