I don't know whether I like cooking or just eating the resulting food.
In any case, there are quite a few recipes to which I have taken a liking.
These come from various sources, be it the internet, cooking books, or just "secret knowledge"
passed down the family tree.
In many cases, I have also adapted them to either my own preferences or the demands of my family.

My ultimate goal with this page is to, step by step, populate this page with the recipes that
I use, readily accessible from everywhere.

> Since I am from Germany, I will also publish the recipes in german language only.
